Java Access Modifiers
In Java, access modifiers define the scope and visibility of classes, methods, and variables. The four main modifiers are:
public → Accessible from anywhere in the project.
protected → Accessible within the same package and by subclasses.
default (no keyword) → Accessible only within the same package.
private → Accessible only within the same class.
They help enforce encapsulation and control how different parts of a program interact with each other.
